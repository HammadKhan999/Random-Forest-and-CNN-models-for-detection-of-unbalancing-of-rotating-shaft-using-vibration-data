Random Forest and CNN models for detection of unbalancing of rotating shaft using vibration data

This project aim to develop a model for
detecting unbalance in rotating shafts using vibration data.
The project utilizes Python and explores the implementation
of two machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used
for training and testing the models is obtained from Vibration
Analysis on Rotating Shafts on Kaggle. The project follows
a systematic approach involving data preprocessing, feature
selection, model development, evaluation, and implementation.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score are used to assess the modelsâ€™ performance.
